Ethernaut Level 07 - Force,https://blog.dixitaditya.com/ethernaut-level-07-force,"The goal of this level is to send some balance to the contract. 
The caveat is this is an empty contract without any functions, fallbacks, etc. Don't be fooled by the cute cat.

The concept behind this level is how we can forcefully send Ether to a contract. Let's dive in. 
There are currently three ways in which you can forcefully send Ether to a contract even when it does not have any implementations to receive funds. They are:
selfdestruct()
selfdestruct()
Let's make use of our newly acquired concepts and forcefully send some Ether. The easiest way is by making use of a selfdestruct() function. 
selfdestruct()
selfdestruct()
It is a function which is used to delete a contract from the blockchain and remove it's code and storage. Here's how it looks:
selfdestruct(addr);

Whenever this is called, the Ether stored in the contract from which it is being called will be sent to the addr mentioned in the arguments. 
addr
Therefore, to finish this level, we just need to deploy a contract, fund it with some Ether, and use a selfdestruct() with the address of the Ethernaut's instance to forcefully send the balance to that contract. 
selfdestruct()
Here's how our exploit code looks:
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

contract Forced{
    constructor () public payable {
        selfdestruct(0x570F2d712F9247d8eeaC3bf9ef1300b1b29cF480);
    }
}

Let's deploy this contract using the following command. 
forge create Forced --private-key $PKEY --rpc-url $RPC_URL --value 0.00001ether

I've created a simple contract that has a payable constructor. It means I can send some Ether at the time of deployment. This Ether will then be forwarded to the instance address mentioned in the selfdestruct() call and our contract will be destroyed. 
selfdestruct()

The new balance of the Ethernaut's contract can be checked on Etherscan as a result of our selfdestruct() call:
selfdestruct()

The instance can be submitted to finish the level.
